# This is the coding challenge

## 48HR CODING CHALLENGE

Todo lists are a staple in beginning webdev tutorials because they can be very simple. There is, however, a lot of room for improvement and many features that can be added.

Before diving into the code test, take a minute to think about how you are going to want to organize your project. Here are the requirements:

Your app has Todo items and Todo projects

Brainstorm what kind of properties your todo-items are going to have. At a minimum they should have a title, description, due-date and priority.

You might also want to include notes or even a checklist.

Each Todo item belongs to a project.

Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their toDos go into.

Your API should have the following endpoints:

View all projects
View all toDos in each project (probably just the title and due-date.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
Get a single todo to see/edit its details
Delete a todo
Your project should be built on Laravel, hosted on GitHub and completed in 24 hours. Please let us know when you are done.
